Implementation of Stochastic Class-based Hard Example Mining for Deep Metric Learning in Tensorflow 2.1.0


Guide:

    Load CUB dataset into root directory CUB_200_2011. Images should be located in CUB_200_2011/images/*
    Run Create_CUB_Dataset.py to reshape the CUB images and save them all as .npy files
    Run Train_Model.py with parameters to start training
